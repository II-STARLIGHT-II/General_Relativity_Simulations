# Week 7: Mercuryâ€™s Precession with Post-Newtonian Corrections

This project introduces Post-Newtonian corrections (PN1, PN2, and PN2.5) to simulate the relativistic precession of Mercury's orbit. The simulation applies these corrections using a Leapfrog integrator and compares the results with theoretical predictions from General Relativity.

## Features
- Post-Newtonian corrections (PN1, PN2, PN2.5) applied to Mercury's orbit.
- Leapfrog integration for stable and accurate precession simulations.
- Comparison of numerical precession with theoretical values.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/General_Relativity_Simulations.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the Week 7 project folder:
    ```bash
    cd General_Relativity_Simulations/Week7_Mercury_Precession_PN
    ```

3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib
    ```

### Running the Simulation

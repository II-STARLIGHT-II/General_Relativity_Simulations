# Week 6: Post-Newtonian Approximation

This project introduces Post-Newtonian corrections (PN1, PN2, and PN2.5) to the Leapfrog integrator, allowing for a more accurate simulation of relativistic effects in Mercury’s orbit. These corrections simulate the effects of General Relativity on orbital dynamics.

## Features
- Leapfrog integration with Post-Newtonian corrections (PN1, PN2, PN2.5).
- Simulates relativistic precession of Mercury’s orbit.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/General_Relativity_Simulations.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the Week 6 project folder:
    ```bash
    cd General_Relativity_Simulations/Week6_PN_Corrections
    ```

3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib
    ```

### Running the Simulation

To simulate Mercury’s orbit with Post-Newtonian corrections:
```bash
python pn_corrections.py

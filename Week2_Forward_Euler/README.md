# Week 2: Forward Euler Integration

This project implements the Forward Euler algorithm to integrate the motion of the Sun-Earth and Sun-Mercury systems. The goal is to simulate planetary orbits using a simple first-order numerical integrator.

## Features
- Forward Euler integration of planetary orbits.
- Simulates Earth and Mercury orbits over one period.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/General_Relativity_Simulations.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the Week 2 project folder:
    ```bash
    cd General_Relativity_Simulations/Week2_Forward_Euler
    ```

3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib
    ```

### Running the Simulation

To simulate Earthâ€™s orbit with Forward Euler:
```bash
python forward_euler.py

# Week 1: Gravitational Two-Body Problem

This project simplifies the gravitational two-body problem into an effective one-body problem using the center of mass. The goal is to calculate the initial conditions for the Sun-Earth and Sun-Mercury systems, simulating their relative orbits.

## Features
- Calculate initial positions and velocities.
- Simulate orbits using basic gravitational equations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NumPy

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/General_Relativity_Simulations.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the Week 1 project folder:
    ```bash
    cd General_Relativity_Simulations/Week1_Gravitational_2Body
    ```

3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    ```

### Running the Simulation

Run the following command to simulate the two-body problem:
```bash
python two_body_problem.py

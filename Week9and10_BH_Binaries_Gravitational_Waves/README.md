# Week 9 and 10: Black Hole Binaries and Gravitational Waves

This project simulates the orbital decay of a binary black hole system due to the emission of gravitational waves. The Leapfrog integrator with 2.5PN (Post-Newtonian) corrections is used to simulate the gradual reduction in the semi-major axis and eccentricity of the binary system over time.

## Features
- Leapfrog integration with 2.5PN corrections.
- Simulates orbital decay and precession in both eccentric and circular black hole binary systems.
- Calculation of the decay rate due to gravitational wave emission.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/General_Relativity_Simulations.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the Week 9 and 10 project folder:
    ```bash
    cd General_Relativity_Simulations/Week9and10_BH_Binaries_Gravitational_Waves
    ```

3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib
    ```

### Running the Simulation

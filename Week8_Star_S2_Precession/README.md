# Week 8: Precession of Star S2

This project simulates the precession of the star S2, which orbits the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy (Sagittarius A*). The simulation includes both Newtonian and relativistic effects, particularly the Post-Newtonian corrections, to accurately model the star's orbital precession over time.

## Features
- Newtonian and Post-Newtonian dynamics applied to S2's orbit.
- Simulation of relativistic precession caused by Sagittarius A*'s gravitational field.
- Comparison of numerical results with observational data of S2.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/General_Relativity_Simulations.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the Week 8 project folder:
    ```bash
    cd General_Relativity_Simulations/Week8_Star_S2_Precession
    ```

3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib
    ```

### Running the Simulation

To simulate the precession of Star S2 around Sagittarius A*:
```bash
python star_s2_precession.py

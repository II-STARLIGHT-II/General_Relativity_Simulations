# Week 5: Precession of Mercury’s Orbit

This project calculates the numerical precession of Mercury’s perihelion using the Leapfrog integrator with variable time-step. The precession is compared to the theoretical value predicted by General Relativity.

## Features
- Simulates Mercury’s orbit with and without relativistic corrections.
- Compares numerical precession with the theoretical General Relativity prediction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/General_Relativity_Simulations.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the Week 5 project folder:
    ```bash
    cd General_Relativity_Simulations/Week5_Mercury_Precession
    ```

3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib
    ```

### Running the Simulation

To simulate the precession of Mercury’s orbit:
```bash
python mercury_precession.py

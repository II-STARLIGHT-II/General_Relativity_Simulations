# Week 3: Leapfrog Integration

This project implements the Leapfrog algorithm for more stable and accurate orbit integration. The goal is to simulate the Sun-Earth and Sun-Mercury systems using this second-order integrator.

## Features
- Leapfrog integration for stable planetary orbits.
- Simulates both Earth and Mercury orbits.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/General_Relativity_Simulations.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the Week 3 project folder:
    ```bash
    cd General_Relativity_Simulations/Week3_Leapfrog
    ```

3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib
    ```

### Running the Simulation

To simulate Earthâ€™s orbit using the Leapfrog integrator:
```bash
python leapfrog.py
